# What the Web offers to scientists

 - Support for collaboration

 - Computation as a service

 - Publication

 - Cloud storage and computing

 - Social networks

 - Other services

---

# Web services are fragile

 - Web services change or disappear rapidly.

 - Their business models can be unclear, or contrary to your interests.

 - Play with Web services as you like, but don't depend on them without
   checking if they are trustworthy:

   + Evaluate their business model and integrity.
   + Do the people behind them look competent?
   + Does the service have the means to stay around for a while?
   + Can you get your data out to avoid becoming dependent?

Sometimes Web services disappear because they are not economically
interesting for their owners. Examples are [Google Code](http://code.google.com/)
and [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader/about/),
which were popular but did not generate advertising revenue for Google.

Sometimes Web services disappear because of insufficient technical precautions. 
See [this article](http://www.infoworld.com/article/2608076/data-center/murder-in-the-amazon-cloud.html)
for the story of [Code Spaces](http://www.codespaces.com/).

Many Web services prefer to hide their business model, because it is
against the interests of their users. In particular, many free services
sell the data you upload for advertising purposes.

# Collaboration

 - [Open Science Framework](http://osf.io/), the [Open Notebook Science Network](http://onsnetwork.org/),
   and [Synapse](https://www.synapse.org/) manage shared research data.

 - [GitHub](http://github.com/) - you have used it yourself.
   [Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org/) provides similar services.

 - Collaborative computation (e.g. [coLaboratory](http://colaboratory.jupyter.org/)).

 - Collaborative editing/note taking: [Etherpad](https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/),
   [Google Docs](http://docs.google.com/)

 - Mozilla Science's [Collaborate](http://www.mozillascience.org/collaborate)
   network aims to create collaborations on scientific software.

 - Problem-oriented sites such as [polymath](http://polymathprojects.org/)
   invite anyone to contribute to the solution of scientific problems.

 - Crowdfunding sites such as
   [experiment.com](https://experiment.com/),
   [Petridish](http://www.petridish.org/), or
   [SciFlies](http://www.sciflies.org/) bring together
   researchers and funders for small but innovative projects.

 - Distributed computing projects [SETI@home](http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/), [Folding@home](http://folding.stanford.edu/) ask for volunteer contributions
   of computing resources.

 - [Citizen Science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_science) invites
   the public to participate in research projects.

# Computation as a service

 - Simple principle: you upload some data, enter some parameters, push
   a button, and download the result.

 - Often provided by research groups to encourage adoption of their
   methods. Evaluate their claims critically.

 - Sometimes provided by universities primarily for educational purposes.

 - Sometimes provided by research institutions as a community service.

### Watch out

 - A computational service may disappear at any time.

 - Or it may update its software and produce different results.

 - Some services do not explain the methods they apply in detail, nor
   provide version numbers for their software. You don't really know what
   is being computed.

 - Don't upload confidential data.

# Computation as a service

### Randomly picked examples from my field of research

 - [2Struc](http://2struc.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/): secondary structure
   of proteins

 - [LIPS](http://tanto.bioe.uic.edu/lips/): prediction of
   helix-lipid interfaces

 - [WEBnm@](http://apps.cbu.uib.no/webnma/home):
   Normal Mode Analysis of proteins

### Graphics and visualization

 - [plotly](https://plot.ly/): plots and charts

 - [Google Charts](https://developers.google.com/chart/): plots and charts

 - See this [list](http://datavisualization.ch/tools/selected-tools/)
   which also covers libraries for Web programmers

# Publication

 - Preprint servers: [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/), [bioRχiv](http://biorxiv.org/).
   [archive.it](http://rchive.it/) will tell you which journals accept
   submissions already available as preprints.

 - The [Journal Selector](http://www.edanzediting.com/journal_selector)
   helps you find an appropriate journal for your paper.

 - [Authorea](http://www.authorea.com/) and
   [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/): collaborative writing of
   scientific publications.

 - Citable publication of datasets, figures, software, ...:
   [Zenodo](http://zenodo.org/), [figshare](http://figshare.com/)

 - Publishing datasets of unlimited size:
   [Academic Torrents](http://www.academictorrents.com/)

 - Publication of executable code with datasets:
   [Exec&Share](http://execandshare.org/)

# Web-only scientific journals

There is a growing number of scientific journals that have no
print edition. Many use an Open Access model. Example:
the [PLOS](https://www.plos.org/) journals.

A few journals introduce new reviewing models, in particular
open reviewing:

 - [F1000Research](http://f1000research.com/)

 - [PeerJ](https://peerj.com/)

 - [The Winnower](http://thewinnower.com/)

 - [ReScience](http://rescience.github.io/) (lives entirely on GitHub)

The [Self-Journal of Science](http://sjscience.org/) and
[PubPub](http://pubpub.media.mit.edu/) go one step
further and add curation - anyone can be a journal editor.

# Presentations

### Web services

 - [Slideshare](http://slideshare.com/) for sharing presentations

 - [SlideWiki](http://slidewiki.org/): on-line editor for collaborative
   editing of presentations.

 - [Prezi](http://prezi.com/) on-line presentation editor (commercial)

### Tools for Web-based presentations

 - [remark.js](http://remarkjs.com/) - what I use for these slides

 - [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/) has its own
   [on-line slide editor](https://slides.com/)

 - [deck.js](http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/) - particularly interesting
   for use with [Browsercast](https://github.com/twitwi/deck.browsercast.js/)

---

# Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs)

 - Permanent identifiers for digital publications.

 - Used by all scientific journals for referring to articles.

 - [Zenodo](http://zenodo.org/) and [figshare](http://figshare.com/)
   assign a DOI to each published dataset.

 - DOI lookup: http://dx.doi.org/

### Why not simply use a URL (Uniform Resource Locator)?

 - URLs identify a storage location, DOIs identify the data

 - DOIs are permanent:
   - DOIs are meant to be valid "forever".
   - a DOI should always point to "the same" digital object

In practice, the detailed meaning of permanence is quite variable. Some
publishers allow updating a digital object under the same DOI, others
assign a new DOI to each version.

---

# Cloud storage and computing

 - Backup storage for data: [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com/),
   [Google Drive](http://drive.google.com/), ...

 - Scientific computing: [OSDC](https://www.opensciencedatacloud.org/),
   [Red Cloud](https://www.cac.cornell.edu/redcloud/),
   [Wakari](https://wakari.io/)

 - Virtual machines and large-scale data storage:
   - [Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud](http://aws.amazon.com/fr/ec2/)
   - [Google Cloud Platform](http://cloud.google.com/)
   - many, many more - this is big business by now

---

# Social networks

On these sites, you can construct an on-line showcase containing
your CV and publications, and subscribe to news from colleagues.

 - [Academia.edu](http://www.academia.edu/)
 - [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/)
 - [ResearchGate](http://www.researchgate.net/)
 - [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/)
 - [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/)

A special case is

 - [ORCID](http://orcid.org/)

which assigns a unique ID to each researcher, hosts their publication
list, and is increasingly used by journals to uniquely identify authors.

---

# The future of scientific research

 > _Prediction is always uncertain, especially if it concerns the future._
 > ([attributed to various famous people](http://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/10/20/no-predict/))

Scientific research is changing faster than ever before. Computing
and Web technologies play an important role in this change.

 > _First we shape our tools, and then our tools shape us._
 > ([mistakenly attributed to  Marshall McLuhan](https://mcluhangalaxy.wordpress.com/2013/04/01/we-shape-our-tools-and-thereafter-our-tools-shape-us/))

Some starting points for exploring possible futures:

 - [Reinventing Discovery](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691148902/ref=as_li_tf_tl?tag=michaniels-20) by [Michael Nielsen](http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/michael-a-nielsen/), and his [TEDx talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/michael_nielsen_open_science_now) on Open Science show realistic scenarios for the evolution of science.

 - A more technical [book](http://book.openingscience.org/) on Open Science
   looks into many aspects in detail.

 - A [collection of articles](http://www.scienceopen.com/collection/Science20)
   on new developments in scientific publishing.
