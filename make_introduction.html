# Introduction

Suppose we have a script, `wordcount.py`, that reads in a text file,
counts the words in this text file, and outputs a data file:

~~~ {.bash}
$ python wordcount.py books/isles.txt isles.dat
~~~

If we view the first 5 rows of the data file using `head`,

~~~ {.bash}
$ head -5 isles.dat
~~~

we can see that the file consists of one row per word. 

~~~ {.output}
the 3822 6.7371760973
of 2460 4.33632998414
and 1723 3.03719372466
to 1479 2.60708619778
a 1308 2.30565838181
~~~

---

Each row shows the word itself, the number of occurrences of that
word, and the number of occurrences as a percentage of the total
number of words in the text file. As another example:

~~~ {.bash}
$ python wordcount.py books/abyss.txt abyss.dat
$ head -5 abyss.dat
~~~

~~~ {.output}
the 4044 6.35449402891
and 2807 4.41074795726
of 1907 2.99654305468
a 1594 2.50471401634
to 1515 2.38057825267
~~~

Suppose we also have a script, `plotcount.py`, that reads in a data
file and plots the 10 most frequently occurring words:

~~~ {.bash}
$ python plotcount.py isles.dat show
~~~

Close the window to exit the plot.

---

`plotcount.py` can also save the plot as an image (e.g. a PNG file):

~~~ {.bash}
$ python plotcount.py isles.dat isles.png
~~~

It is possible that `plotcount.py` does not work on your computer
because it does not have a sufficiently complete Python installation.
In that case, use `plotcount_text.py` instead. It produces a crude
approximation to a histogram by printing asterisks.

Together these scripts implement a common workflow:

1. Read a data file.
2. Perform an analysis on this data file.
3. Write the analysis results to a new file.
4. Plot a graph of the analysis results.
5. Save the graph as an image, so we can put it in a paper.

---

Running `wordcount.py` and `plotcount.py` at the shell prompt, as we
have been doing, is fine for one or two files. If, however, we had 5
or 10 or 20 text files, this would quickly become monotonous. We could
write a shell script to loop over our text files and create data files
and images for each in turn, but this too can cause problems. If a
text file changes then we need to re-run our analysis and recreate our
graph, but only for the text file that changed, not all of
them. Furthermore, we only want do this if and only if the text file
has changed.

Make was developed by 
Stuart Feldman in 1977 as a Bell Labs summer intern, and remains in
widespread use today. Make can execute the commands needed to run our
analysis and plot our results. Like shell scripts it allows us to
execute complex sequences of commands via a single shell
command. Unlike shell scripts it explicitly records the dependencies
between files and so can determine when to recreate our data files or
image files, if our text files change. Make can be used for any
commands that follow the general pattern of processing files to create
new files, for example: 

* Run analysis scripts on raw data files to get data files that
  summarise the raw data. 
* Run visualisation scripts on data files to produce plots.
* Parse and combine text files and plots to create papers.
* Compile source code into executable programs or libraries.

---

There are now many build tools available, for example [Apache
ANT](http://ant.apache.org/), [doit](http://pydoit.org/), and
[nmake](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd9y37ha.aspx) for
Windows. There are also build tools that build scripts for use with
these build tools and others e.g. [GNU
Autoconf](http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/autoconf.html) and
[CMake](http://www.cmake.org/). Which is best for you depends on your
requirements, intended usage, and operating system. However, they
all share the same fundamental concepts as Make.

[GNU Make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/) is a free, fast, 
well-documented, very popular and highly extended one of some 
Make implements. From now on, we will focus on it, then when 
we say Make, we mean GNU Make.

# Makefiles

Create a file, called `Makefile`, with the following content:

~~~ {.make}
# Count words.
isles.dat : books/isles.txt
        python wordcount.py books/isles.txt isles.dat
~~~

This is a simple [build file](https://swcarpentry.github.io/make-novice/reference.html#build-file), which for
Make is called a [Makefile](https://swcarpentry.github.io/make-novice/reference.html#makefile) - a file executed
by Make. Let us go through each line in turn:

* `#` denotes a *comment*. Any text from `#` to the end of the line is
  ignored by Make.
* `isles.dat` is a [target](https://swcarpentry.github.io/make-novice/reference.html#target), a file to be
  created, or built.
* `books/isles.txt` is a [dependency](https://swcarpentry.github.io/make-novice/reference.html#dependency), a
  file that is needed to build or update the target. Targets can have
  zero or more dependencies.
* `:` separates targets from dependencies.
* `python wordcount.py books/isles.txt isles.dat` is an
  [action](https://swcarpentry.github.io/make-novice/reference.html#action), a command to run to build or update
  the target using the dependencies. Targets can have zero or more
  actions.
* Actions are indented using the TAB character, *not* 8 spaces. This
  is a legacy of Make's 1970's origins.
* Together, the target, dependencies, and actions form a
  [rule](https://swcarpentry.github.io/make-novice/reference.html#rule). 

---

Our rule above describes how to build the target `isles.dat` using the
action `python wordcount.py` and the dependency `books/isles.txt`.

Let's first sure we start from scratch and delete the `.dat` and `.png`
files we created:

~~~ {.bash}
$ rm *.dat *.png
~~~

By default, Make looks for a Makefile, called `Makefile`, and we can
run Make as follows:

~~~ {.bash}
$ make
~~~

Make prints out the actions it executes:

~~~ {.output}
python wordcount.py books/isles.txt isles.dat
~~~

---

If we see,

~~~ {.error}
Makefile:3: *** missing separator.  Stop.
~~~

then we have used a space instead of a TAB characters to indent one of
our actions.

We don't have to call our Makefile `Makefile`. However, if we call it
something else we need to tell Make where to find it. This we can do
using `-f` flag. For example:

~~~ {.bash}
$ make -f Makefile
~~~

As we have re-run our Makefile, Make now informs us that:

~~~ {.output}
make: `isles.dat' is up to date.
~~~

---

This is because our target, `isles.dat`, has now been created, and
Make will not create it again. To see how this works, let's pretend to
update one of the text files. Rather than opening the file in an
editor, we can use the shell `touch` command to update its timestamp
(which would happen if we did edit the file):

~~~ {.bash}
$ touch books/isles.txt
~~~

If we compare the timestamps of `books/isles.txt` and `isles.dat`,

~~~ {.bash}
$ ls -l books/isles.txt isles.dat
~~~

then we see that `isles.dat`, the target, is now older
than `books/isles.txt`, its dependency:

~~~ {.output}
-rw-r--r--    1 mjj      Administ   323972 Jun 12 10:35 books/isles.txt
-rw-r--r--    1 mjj      Administ   182273 Jun 12 09:58 isles.dat
~~~

---

If we run Make again,

~~~ {.bash}
$ make
~~~

then it recreates `isles.dat`:

~~~ {.output}
python wordcount.py books/isles.txt isles.dat
~~~

When it is asked to build a target, Make checks the 'last modification
time' of both the target and its dependencies. If any dependency has
been updated since the target, then the actions are re-run to update
the target.

Let's add another rule to the end of `Makefile`:

~~~ {.make}
abyss.dat : books/abyss.txt
        python wordcount.py books/abyss.txt abyss.dat
~~~

---

If we run Make,

~~~ {.bash}
$ make
~~~

then we get:

~~~ {.output}
make: `isles.dat' is up to date.
~~~

Nothing happens because Make attempts to build the first target it
finds in the Makefile, the [default
target](https://swcarpentry.github.io/make-novice/reference.html#default-target), which is `isles.dat` which is
already up-to-date. We need to explicitly tell Make we want to build
`abyss.dat`: 

~~~ {.bash}
$ make abyss.dat
~~~

Now, we get:

~~~ {.output}
python wordcount.py books/abyss.txt abyss.dat
~~~

---

We may want to remove all our data files so we can explicitly recreate
them all. We can introduce a new target, and associated rule, `clean`:

~~~ {.make}
clean : 
        rm -f *.dat
~~~

This is an example of a rule that has no dependencies. `clean` has no
dependencies on any `.dat` file as it makes no sense to create these
just to remove them. We just want to remove the data files whether or
not they exist. If we run Make and specify this target,

~~~ {.bash}
$ make clean
~~~

then we get:

~~~ {.output}
rm -f *.dat
~~~

---

There is no actual thing built called `clean`. Rather, it is a
short-hand that we can use to execute a useful sequence of
actions. Such targets, though very useful, can lead to problems. For
example, let us recreate our data files, create a directory called
`clean`, then run Make:

~~~ {.bash}
$ make isles.dat abyss.dat
$ mkdir clean
$ make clean
~~~

We get:

~~~ {.outputs}
make: `clean' is up to date.
~~~

Make finds a file (or directory) called `clean` and, as its `clean`
rule has no dependencies, assumes that `clean` has been built and is
up-to-date and so does not execute the rule's actions.

---

As we are using `clean` as a short-hand, we need to tell Make to
always execute this rule if we run `make clean`, by telling Make that
this is a [phony target](#https://swcarpentry.github.io/make-novice/reference.html#phony-target), that it does
not build anything. This we do by marking the target as `.PHONY`:

~~~ {.make}
.PHONY : clean
clean : 
        rm -f *.dat
~~~

If we run Make,

~~~ {.bash}
$ make clean
~~~

then we get:

~~~ {.outputs}
rm -f *.dat
~~~

---

We can add a similar command to create all the data files. We can put
this at the top of our Makefile so that it is the [default
target](https://swcarpentry.github.io/make-novice/reference.html#default-target), which is executed by default 
if no target is given to the `make` command:

~~~ {.make}
.PHONY : dats
dats : isles.dat abyss.dat
~~~

This is an example of a rule that has dependencies that are targets of
other rules. When Make runs, it will check to see if the dependencies
exist and, if not, will see if rules are available that will create
these. If such rules exist it will invoke these first, otherwise
Make will raise an error.

This rule is also an example of a rule that has no actions. It is used
purely to trigger the build of its dependencies, if needed.

---

If we run,

~~~ {.bash}
$ make dats
~~~

then Make creates the data files:

~~~ {.output}
python wordcount.py books/isles.txt isles.dat
python wordcount.py books/abyss.txt abyss.dat
~~~

If we run `dats` again,

~~~ {.bash}
$ make dats
~~~

then Make sees that the data files exist:

~~~ {.output}
make: Nothing to be done for `dats'.
~~~

---

Our Makefile now looks like this:

~~~ {.make}
# Count words.
.PHONY : dats
dats : isles.dat abyss.dat

isles.dat : books/isles.txt
        python wordcount.py books/isles.txt isles.dat

abyss.dat : books/abyss.txt
        python wordcount.py books/abyss.txt abyss.dat

.PHONY : clean
clean :
        rm -f *.dat
~~~

---

The following figure shows the dependencies embodied within our Makefile, involved in building the `dats` target:

![Dependencies represented within the Makefile](images/02-makefile.png "Dependencies represented within the Makefile")

---

## Exercice: write two new rules

Write a new rule for `last.dat`, created from `books/last.txt`.

Update the `dats` rule with this target.

Write a new rule for `analysis.tar.gz`, which creates an archive of
the data files. The rule needs to: 

* Depend upon each of the three `.dat` files.
* Invoke the action `tar -czf analysis.tar.gz isles.dat abyss.dat
  last.dat` 

Put this rule at the top of the Makefile so that it is the default target.

Update `clean` so that it removes `analysis.tar.gz`.

---

The following figure shows the dependencies embodied within our Makefile, involved in building the `analysis.tar.gz` target:

![analysis.tar.gz dependencies represented within the Makefile](images/02-makefile-challenge.png "analysis.tar.gz dependencies represented within the Makefile")

---

# Variables

After the exercise at the end of the previous part, our Makefile look like this:

~~~ {.make}
# Generate archive file.
analysis.tar.gz : isles.dat abyss.dat last.dat
        tar -czf analysis.tar.gz isles.dat abyss.dat last.dat

# Count words.
.PHONY : dats
dats : isles.dat abyss.dat last.dat

isles.dat : books/isles.txt
        python wordcount.py books/isles.txt isles.dat

abyss.dat : books/abyss.txt
        python wordcount.py books/abyss.txt abyss.dat

last.dat : books/last.txt
        python wordcount.py books/last.txt last.dat

.PHONY : clean
clean :
        rm -f *.dat
        rm -f analysis.tar.gz
~~~

---

Our Makefile has a lot of duplication. For example, the names of text
files and data files are repeated in many places throughout the
Makefile. Makefiles are a form of code and, in any code, repeated code
can lead to problems e.g. we rename a data file in one part of the
Makefile but forget the rename it elsewhere. Let us set about removing
some of this repetition.

In our `analysis.tar.gz` rule we duplicate the data file names and the
archive name:

~~~ {.make}
analysis.tar.gz : isles.dat abyss.dat last.dat
        tar -czf analysis.tar.gz isles.dat abyss.dat last.dat
~~~

Looking at the archive name first, we can replace it in the action
with `$@`:

~~~ {.make}
analysis.tar.gz : isles.dat abyss.dat last.dat
        tar -czf $@ isles.dat abyss.dat last.dat
~~~

`$@` is a Make [automatic variable](https://swcarpentry.github.io/make-novice/reference.html#automatic-variable)
which means 'the target of the current rule'. When Make is run it will
replace this variable with the target name.

---

We can replace the dependencies in the action with `$^`:

~~~ {.make}
analysis.tar.gz : isles.dat abyss.dat last.dat
        tar -czf $@ $^
~~~

`$^` is another automatic variable which means 'all the dependencies
of the current rule'. Again, when Make is run it will replace this
variable with the dependencies.
 
Let's update our text files and re-run our rule:

~~~ {.bash}
$ touch books/*.txt
$ make analysis.tar.gz
~~~

We get:

~~~ {.output}
python wordcount.py books/isles.txt isles.dat
python wordcount.py books/abyss.txt abyss.dat
python wordcount.py books/last.txt last.dat
tar -czf analysis.tar.gz isles.dat abyss.dat last.dat
~~~

---

We can use the bash wild-card in our dependency list:

~~~ {.make}
analysis.tar.gz : *.dat
        tar -czf $@ $^
~~~

Let's update our text files and re-run our rule:

~~~ {.bash}
$ touch books/*.txt
$ make analysis.tar.gz
~~~

We get the same as above.

Now let's delete the data files and re-run our rule:

~~~ {.bash}
$ make clean
$ make analysis.tar.gz
~~~

---

We get:

~~~ {.error}
make: *** No rule to make target `*.dat', needed by `analysis.tar.gz'.  Stop.
~~~

As there are no files that match the pattern `*.dat` the name `*.dat`
is used as a file name itself, and there is no file matching that, nor
any rule so we get an error. We need to explicitly rebuild the `.dat`
files first:

~~~ {.bash}
$ make dats
$ make analysis.tar.gz
~~~

---

## Exercice: updating dependencies

What will happen if you now execute:

~~~ {.bash}
$ touch *.dat
$ make analysis.tar.gz
~~~

1. nothing
2. all files recreated
3. only .dat files recreated
4. only analysis.tar.gz recreated

Please try to find the correct answer before actually running the
commands to see what happens!

---

As we saw, `$^` means 'all the dependencies of the current
rule'. This works well for `analysis.tar.gz` as its action 
treats all the dependencies the same - as the contents of the
archive.

However, for some rules, we may want to treat the first dependency
differently. For example, our rules for `.dat` use their first (and
only) dependency specifically as the input file to `wordcount.py`. If
we add additional dependencies (as we will soon do) then we don't want
these being passed as input files to `wordcount.py` as it expects only
one input file to be named when it is invoked.

Make provides an automatic variable for this, `$<` which means 'the
first dependency of the current rule'. 

---

## Exercice: rewrite `.dat` rules to use automatic variables

Rewrite each `.dat` rule to use the automatic variables `$@` ('the
target of the current rule') and `$<` ('the first dependency of the
current rule').

---

# Dependencies

Our Makefile now looks like this:

~~~ {.make}
# Generate archive file.
analysis.tar.gz : *.dat
	tar -czf $@ $^

# Count words.
.PHONY : dats
dats : isles.dat abyss.dat last.dat

isles.dat : books/isles.txt
	python wordcount.py $< $@

abyss.dat : books/abyss.txt
	python wordcount.py $< $@

last.dat : books/last.txt
	python wordcount.py $< $@

.PHONY : clean
clean :
        rm -f *.dat
        rm -f analysis.tar.gz
~~~

---

Our data files are a product not only of our text files but the
script, `wordcount.py`, that processes the text files and creates the
data files. We should add `wordcount.py` as a dependency of each of our
data files also:

~~~ {.make}
isles.dat : books/isles.txt wordcount.py
	python wordcount.py $< $@

abyss.dat : books/abyss.txt wordcount.py
	python wordcount.py $< $@

last.dat : books/last.txt wordcount.py
	python wordcount.py $< $@
~~~

If we pretend to edit `wordcount.py` and re-run Make,

~~~ {.bash}
$ touch wordcount.py
$ make dats
~~~

then we get:

~~~ {.output}
python wordcount.py books/isles.txt isles.dat
python wordcount.py books/abyss.txt abyss.dat
python wordcount.py books/last.txt last.dat
~~~

---

The following figure shows the dependencies embodied within our Makefile, involved in building the `analysis.tar.gz` target, after adding `wordcount.py` as a dependency to the `.dat` files:

![analysis.tar.gz dependencies after adding wordcount.py as a dependency](images/04-dependencies.png "analysis.tar.gz dependencies after adding wordcount.py as a dependency")

---

Let's add our analysis script to the archive too:

~~~ {.make}
analysis.tar.gz : *.dat wordcount.py
        tar -czf $@ $^
~~~

If we re-run Make,

~~~ {.bash}
$ make analysis.tar.gz
~~~

then we get:

~~~ {.output}
tar -czf analysis.tar.gz abyss.dat isles.dat last.dat wordcount.py
~~~

---

# Patterns

Our Makefile still has repeated content. The rules for each `.dat`
file are identical apart from the text and data file names. We can
replace these rules with a single [pattern
rule](https://swcarpentry.github.io/make-novice/reference.html#pattern-rule) which can be used to build any
`.dat` file from a `.txt` file in `books/`:

~~~ {.make}
%.dat : books/%.txt wordcount.py
        python wordcount.py $< $*.dat
~~~

`%` is a Make [wild-card](https://swcarpentry.github.io/make-novice/reference.html#wild-card). `$*` is a special variable which gets replaced by the [stem](https://swcarpentry.github.io/make-novice/reference.html#stem) with which the rule matched.

If we re-run Make,

~~~ {.bash}
$ make clean
$ make dats
~~~

---

then we get:

~~~ {.output}
python wordcount.py books/isles.txt isles.dat
python wordcount.py books/abyss.txt abyss.dat
python wordcount.py books/last.txt last.dat
~~~

Our Makefile is now much shorter and cleaner:

~~~ {.make}
# Generate archive file.
analysis.tar.gz : *.dat wordcount.py
	tar -czf $@ $^

# Count words.
.PHONY : dats
dats : isles.dat abyss.dat last.dat

%.dat : books/%.txt wordcount.py
	python wordcount.py $< $*.dat

.PHONY : clean
clean :
        rm -f *.dat
        rm -f analysis.tar.gz
~~~

---

# Variables

Despite our efforts, our Makefile still has repeated content, namely
the name of our script, `wordcount.py`. If we renamed our script we'd
have to update our Makefile in multiple places.

We can introduce a Make [variable](https://swcarpentry.github.io/make-novice/reference.html#variable) (called a
[macro](https://swcarpentry.github.io/make-novice/reference.html#macro) in some versions of Make) to hold our
script name:

~~~ {.make}
COUNT_SRC=wordcount.py
~~~

This is a variable [assignment](https://swcarpentry.github.io/make-novice/reference.html#assignment) -
`COUNT_SRC` is assigned the value `wordcount.py`.

`wordcount.py` is our script and it is invoked by passing it to
`python`. We can introduce another variable to represent this
execution:

~~~ {.make}
COUNT_EXE=python $(COUNT_SRC)
~~~

---

`$(...)` tells Make to replace a variable with its value when Make
is run. This is a variable [reference](https://swcarpentry.github.io/make-novice/reference.html#reference). At 
any place where we want to use the value of a variable we have to
write it, or reference it, in this way.

Here we reference the variable `COUNT_SRC`. This tells Make to 
replace the variable `COUNT_SRC` with its value `wordcount.py`. When
Make is run it will assign to `COUNT_EXE` the value `python
wordcount.py`.

Defining the variable `COUNT_EXE` in this way allows us to easily
change how our script is run (if, for example, we changed the language
used to implement our script from Python to R).

---

## Exercice: use variables

Update `Makefile` so that the `%.dat` and `analysis.tar.gz` rules
reference the variables `COUNT_SRC` and `COUNT_EXE`.

---

Placing variables at the top of a Makefile means they are easy to
find and modify. Alternatively, we can pull them out into a new
Makefile that just holds variable definitions. Let us create
`config.mk`:

~~~ {.make}
# Count words script.
COUNT_SRC=wordcount.py
COUNT_EXE=python $(COUNT_SRC)
~~~

We can then import this Makefile into `Makefile` using:

~~~ {.make}
include config.mk
~~~

We can re-run Make to see that everything still works:

~~~ {.bash}
$ make clean
$ make dats
$ make analysis.tar.gz
~~~

---

We have separated the configuration of our Makefile from its rules,
the parts that do all the work. If we want to change our script name
or how it is executed we just need to edit our configuration file, not
our source code in `Makefile`. Decoupling code from configuration in
this way is good programming practice, as it promotes more modular,
flexible and reusable code.

# Functions

At this point, we have the following Makefile:

~~~ {.make}
include config.mk

# Generate archive file.
analysis.tar.gz : *.dat $(COUNT_SRC)
	tar -czf $@ $^

# Count words.
.PHONY : dats
dats : isles.dat abyss.dat last.dat

%.dat : books/%.txt $(COUNT_SRC)
	$(COUNT_EXE) $< $*.dat

.PHONY : clean
clean :
        rm -f *.dat
        rm -f analysis.tar.gz
~~~

---

Make has many [functions](https://swcarpentry.github.io/make-novice/reference.html#function) which can be used to
write more complex rules. One example is `wildcard`. `wildcard` gets a
list of files matching some pattern, which we can then save in a
variable. So, for example, we can get a list of all our text files
(files ending in `.txt`) and save these in a variable by adding this at
the beginning of our makefile:

~~~ {.make}
TXT_FILES=$(wildcard books/*.txt)
~~~

We can add `.PHONY` target and rule to show the variable's value:

~~~ {.make}
.PHONY : variables
variables:
	@echo TXT_FILES: $(TXT_FILES)
~~~

> ## @echo
>
> Make prints actions as it executes them. Using `@` at the start of
> an action tells Make not to print this action. So, by using `@echo`
> instead of `echo`, we can see the result of `echo` (the variable's
> value being printed) but not the `echo` command itself.

---

If we run Make:

~~~ {.bash}
$ make variables
~~~

We get:

~~~ {.output}
TXT_FILES: books/abyss.txt books/isles.txt books/last.txt books/sierra.txt
~~~

Note how `sierra.txt` is now included too.

---

The following figure shows the dependencies embodied within our Makefile, involved in building the `analysis.tar.gz` target, once we have introduced our function:

---

`patsubst` ('pattern substitution') takes a pattern, a replacement string and a
list of names in that order; each name in the list that matches the pattern is 
replaced by the replacement string. Again, we can save the result in a
variable. So, for example, we can rewrite our list of text files into
a list of data files (files ending in `.dat`) and save these in a
variable:

~~~ {.make}
DAT_FILES=$(patsubst books/%.txt, %.dat, $(TXT_FILES))
~~~

We can extend `variables` to show the value of `DAT_FILES` too:

~~~ {.make}
.PHONY : variables
variables:
	@echo TXT_FILES: $(TXT_FILES)
	@echo DAT_FILES: $(DAT_FILES)
~~~

---

If we run Make,

~~~ {.bash}
$ make variables
~~~

then we get:

~~~ {.output}
TXT_FILES: books/abyss.txt books/isles.txt books/last.txt books/sierra.txt
DAT_FILES: abyss.dat isles.dat last.dat sierra.dat
~~~

Now, `sierra.txt` is processed too.

---

With these we can rewrite `clean` and `dats`:

~~~ {.make}
.PHONY : dats
dats : $(DAT_FILES)

.PHONY : clean
clean :
        rm -f $(DAT_FILES)
        rm -f analysis.tar.gz
~~~

Let's check:

~~~ {.bash}
$ make clean
$ make dats
~~~

We get:

~~~ {.output}
python wordcount.py books/abyss.txt abyss.dat
python wordcount.py books/isles.txt isles.dat
python wordcount.py books/last.txt last.dat
python wordcount.py books/sierra.txt sierra.dat
~~~

---

We can also rewrite `analysis.tar.gz` too:

~~~ {.make}
analysis.tar.gz : $(DAT_FILES) $(COUNT_SRC)
	tar -czf $@ $^
~~~

If we re-run Make:

~~~ {.bash}
$ make clean
$ make analysis.tar.gz
~~~

We get:

~~~ {.output}
$ make analysis.tar.gz
python wordcount.py books/abyss.txt abyss.dat
python wordcount.py books/isles.txt isles.dat
python wordcount.py books/last.txt last.dat
python wordcount.py books/sierra.txt sierra.dat
tar -czf analysis.tar.gz abyss.dat isles.dat last.dat sierra.dat wordcount.py
~~~

---

We see that the problem we had when using the bash wild-card, `*.dat`,
which required us to run `make dats` before `make analysis.tar.gz` has
now disappeared, since our functions allow us to create `.dat` file
names from those `.txt` file names in `books/`.

---

Here is our final Makefile:

~~~ {.make}
include config.mk

TXT_FILES=$(wildcard books/*.txt)
DAT_FILES=$(patsubst books/%.txt, %.dat, $(TXT_FILES))

# Generate archive file.
analysis.tar.gz : $(DAT_FILES) $(COUNT_SRC)
	tar -czf $@ $^

# Count words.
.PHONY : dats
dats : $(DAT_FILES)

%.dat : books/%.txt $(COUNT_SRC)
	$(COUNT_EXE) $< $*.dat

.PHONY : clean
clean :
	rm -f $(DAT_FILES)
	rm -f analysis.tar.gz

.PHONY: variables
variables:
	@echo TXT_FILES: $(TXT_FILES)
	@echo DAT_FILES: $(DAT_FILES)
~~~

---

Remember, the `config.mk` file contains:

~~~ {.make}
# Count words script.
COUNT_SRC=wordcount.py
COUNT_EXE=python $(COUNT_SRC)
~~~

# Conclusion

Automated build tools such as Make can help us in a number of
ways. They help us to automate repetitive commands and, so, save us
time and reduce the risk of us making errors we might make if running
these commands manually.

They can also save time by ensuring that automatically-generated
artefacts (such as data files or plots) are only recreated when the
files that were used to create these have changed in some way.

Through their notion of targets, dependencies and actions they serve
as a form of documentation, recording dependencies between code,
scripts, tools, configurations, raw data, derived data, plots and
papers.

## Exercice: extend the Makefile to create PNGs

Add new rules, update existing rules, and add new macros to:

* Create `.png` files from `.dat` files using `plotcount.py`.
* Add the script and `.png` files to the archive.
* Remove all auto-generated files (`.dat`, `.png`,
  `analysis.tar.gz`).
