# Reproducibility in science

 - One of the ideals of science: any competent scientist who repeats your
   work should reach the same conclusions.

 - "Repeating" can mean several things:

   1. Exact **replication** of every single step.
   2. Approximate **replication**: applying published methods
      using similar equipment and samples,
      "filling in the blanks" for unpublished details.
   3. Designing a **different** study following the same general principles,
      which *should* lead to the same conclusions according to the
      accepted state of knowledge in the field.

 - Replication (1. and 2.) verifies a specific result. Reproduction (3.)
   also verifies the current state of knowledge.

 - In experimental science, exact replication is technically impossible.

 - In computational science, exact replication is possible in theory,
   but very difficult in practice.

# The reproducibility crisis

 - Reproducibility and replicability are hot topics in science today,
   as more and more cases of error and fraud are discovered.

 - A [meta-study on medical research](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124) concluded in 2005 that "most published research findings are false".

 - A [video lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPYzY9I78CI) from
   2014 by that study's author provides a broader and up-to-date view
   of the problem.

 - A [reproducibility project in psychology](https://osf.io/ezcuj/)
   found that many published results are not reproducible.

 - *Nature* discusses the topic regularly. The articles are
   grouped in a [Nature special](http://www.nature.com/nature/focus/reproducibility/) entitled "Challenges in irreproducible research".

# Replicability of computational science

 - In computational work, replicability should be perfect, because
   computation is deterministic. Just record everything and play it
   back later.

 - In practice, computational science is _less_ replicable than
   most experiments.

 - The problem: recording _everything_ is very difficult:

   - all the input data: local files, database downloads, ...
   - all the software, including OS, compilers, ...
   - all interactive input,
     including every single mouse click!

 - Better infrastructure support for replication remains a
   research topic. (Here's [my contribution](http://www.activepapers.org/),
   with a [paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.5773.3) providing
   some background.)

 - Similar problems are discussed outside of science
   (e.g. [reproducible software builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/)
   for increasing trust in software)

# Adopt a best-effort approach

Making your work 100% replicable for eternity is not a realistic
goal right now. But you can probably do better than what you are
doing now.

### Replicating your own work on your own computer

Goals:

 - know exactly how every figure in your thesis/paper was produced:
   + input data
   + scripts (under version control)
   + other software (record version numbers)

 - if any dataset or program changes, update computed results
   *automatically*

This is the topic of today's session.

# Workflows

A workflow is a group of coordinated actions (run a program, download
a file, ...) that you perform repeatedly with small modifications
(change parameters, different input datasets, ...) . Most people keep
workflows in memory, or write them down in a notebook.

Two approaches to making a workflow reproducible:

 1. Record all your actions in a way that can be played back.

 2. Write down your actions as instructions for a *workflow manager*,
    and let the workflow manager handle all your computations.

Most workflow tools are based on the second approach. A workflow
is then just another kind of computer program.

# Why workflows matter

Bioinformatics paper in Science, October 2015:

 > "[Ancient Ethiopian genome reveals extensive Eurasian admixture
     throughout the African continent](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/350/6262/820)"

[Erratum](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/26978112/Erratum%20with%20figures.pdf), January 2016:

> The results presented in the Report "Ancient Ethiopian genome
> reveals extensive Eurasian admixture throughout the African continent"
> were affected by a bioinformatics error. **A script** necessary to convert
> the input produced by samtools v0.1.19 to be compatible with PLINK **was
> not run** ...

**This is a mistake typical for non-automated workflows.**

As a consequence of this mistake, the claim of an admixture "throughout
the African continent" is no longer valid.

See this [Nature news story](http://www.nature.com/news/error-found-in-study-of-first-ancient-african-genome-1.19258) for more details.

# Workflow management

### Scripting

A simple approach for simple workflows: write a single script
in your favorite language that does _all_ the computations.

### Command-line workflow managers

 - [Make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/):
   The oldest and most widely used one,
   originally designed for software build processes.
   A bit messy, just like git.

 - [Sake](http://tonyfischetti.github.io/sake/),
   [Drake](http://github.com/Factual/drake),
   [Snakemake](http://bitbucket.org/snakemake/snakemake/wiki/Home) and
   [doit](http://pydoit.org/)
   are recent developments specifically for data workflows.

### Graphical workflow managers

 - [Galaxy](http://galaxyproject.org/),
   [Kepler](http://kepler-project.org/),
   [Taverna](http://www.taverna.org.uk/),
   [VisTrails](http://www.vistrails.org/index.php/Main_Page),
   and probably more.

 - Difficult or impossible to use with version control.

# The Unix command line toolkit

 - Lots of programs with cryptic names and cryptic parameters,
   optimized for rapid typing.

 - Each tool does one task and does it well.

 - Designed to work together.

 - Most tools work with text files or text streams.

 - The output of one tool can be used as the input of another one
   without creating an intermediate file.

 - It’s easy to write a special-purpose tool that integrates with the
   standard tools.

Unix is a family of operating systems that was created in the
1970s. It includes Linux and MacOS X.

The Git for Windows installation contains most of these tools as well.

# Getting started

The lesson on automation with make uses a few commands from the
standard command line toolkit. Figure out what they do as you encounter
them.

 - `man <command>` shows you the manual for a command

 - `apropos <keyword>` lists commands whose manual contains the keyword

Some commands are very frequent, so it's worth learning about them
right now:

~~~
 ls, cd, cp, rm, cat, head, tail, file
~~~

[summary](http://fosswire.com/post/2007/08/unixlinux-command-cheat-sheet/)
of the most common Unix commands.
