# Once upon a time...

Scientists did _experiments_ using simple instruments.

They _wrote down_ what they did, and what they observed,
in their _lab notebook_.

They did this to keep a _record_ of everything they did, because it's
impossible to memorize all the details.

They also used their lab notebooks as _evidence_ that they had actually
done the work they described in their papers.

# Science in the digital age

Traditional lab notebooks are still in use, and often the most convenient choice.

But more and more experiments are controlled by computers, and their results are collected by computers.

Data analysis is almost always done on computers.

Theoreticians run simulations, entirely in their computers.

We need to have the lab notebook in the computer, and we must be able to store computations in the lab notebook!

# The electronic lab notebook

Tasks:

 - Create a log of all research activities

 - Store or reference all data and software

 - Keep track of changes to data and software

 - Share data among collaborators

---

# Longevity of digital information

### The time scale of science

 - Important work is generally recognized as such after 10 years.
 - Many research papers are frequently cited up to 30 years after publication.
 - Older still relevant knowledge migrates to review articles,
   monographs, Wikipedia, etc. The original articles are rarely cited.

**Scientific information must survive in its original form for a few decades.**

### The time scale of computing

 - Software packages are updated a few times per year.
 - Unmaintained software remains useable for a few years.
 - A general-purpose computer remains useful for 5 to 10 years
   with regular updates.
 - Storage media remain useable for 5 to 10 years.
 - Software with a large user base can be maintained for decades.
 - Data stored in simple and documented file formats remain useable
   "forever".

---

# Your data from a computer's point of view

 - All data is stored in _files_.

 - Files are organized in _directories_ / _folders_.

 - A file contains a sequence of _bytes_, i.e. numbers in the range 0-255.

 - All data must be _encoded_ as a sequence of bytes.

 - There are many ways to do this: lots of _file formats_.

---

# The big divide: text vs. binary

### Text formats

 - First, encode your data as human-readable text.
 - Then, encode text as bit sequences.
 - There's general agreement about the second step: [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode)
 - But lots of way to encode data as text.


### Binary formats

 - Everything that's not plain text.
 - Includes Word, Open Office, RTF, ... which are not _plain_ text.
 - Use problem-specific data encoding.
 - Often optimized for a specific purpose.

---

# Pros and cons

### Why use text formats?

 - **Lots** of software tools can handle text.
 - Straightforward inspection "by eye".
 - Relatively easy to write your own specialized tools.
 - More future-proof.

### Why use binary formats?

 - Efficiency: smaller files, faster processing

---

# Open vs. proprietary formats

### Open formats

 - Documented: there is a written definition of the data encoding meant
   for human readers.
 - Used by different software packages

### Proprietary formats

 - Used by one or a few software packages
 - No documentation
 - Often binary, to make reverse-engineering difficult

### Grey zone

 - Formats used by open-source software but not documented except in
   the source code: hard to use in practice.
 - Highly complex binary formats, theoretically documented but
   in practice unusable by anyone except the inventor (Microsoft Word, ...)

---

# File formats for the electronic lab notebook

**_Remember: data is at the core of science_**

## Avoid proprietary formats as much as you can

 - Your software controls your data, not you.
 - One day the software will disappear - and your data along with it.
 - You can't share data with people who use different software.
 - You can't write your own software to handle your data.

## Prefer text formats

  - Lots of useful tools.
  - Easier to handle for everyone.
  - Less dependent on specific software.

---

# Tools for text files

 - Usually created by software developers for software developers

 - Often powerful but not user-friendly

 - Most are designed to be used from a terminal

This style of working may look archaic and certainly requires
some learning effort. Trust me, it will pay off!

# Version control

---

background-image: url(http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive/phd101212s.gif)

---

# A time axis for files

 - Many computer files represent work in progress:
   program source code, scientific publications, theses, ...

 - It is useful to go back to earlier versions, or identify
   what has been changed when and by whom.

 - Traceability is important for collaborative work
   due to the risk of conflicting changes.

A version control system stores	consecutive _versions_ of each file with

 - a time stamp
 - the author of each change
 - a description of the change, provided by its author

Version control systems were created for software development, but are
useful for many other applications.

**Version control is the most important tool to master in this course.**

---

# Choosing a version control system

 - First generation: [RCS](http://www.gnu.org/software/rcs/), [CVS](http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/cvs)

 - Second generation: [Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/)

 - Third generation: [Git](http://git-scm.com/), [Mercurial](http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/), [Bazaar](http://bazaar-vcs.org/)


In this course we use _Git_ because

 - it is very popular, also in science
 - is is supported by the excellent Web service [GitHub](http://github.com/)

Reasons for _not_ using Git:

 - it is very complex
 - its user interface is inconsistent

Alternatives:

  - Mercurial is simpler and a good choice if you can live
    without GitHub.
  - [Gitless](http://people.csail.mit.edu/sperezde/gitless/), a Git-compatible
    system with a cleaner design. Promising, but probably not ready yet for
    large-scale use.
